v0.14.1  [18-AUG-2013]
----------------------
* Fixed a bug in Job#create_or_update method. Credit: [@bobbrez][]

v0.14.0  [07-AUG-2013]
----------------------
* Fixed a bug where a space was missing in the exec_cli method argument list.
  Credit: [@missedone][]
* Refactored create/update jobs by introducing create_or_update methods.
  Credit: [@riywo][]
* Enhancement to crumb processing - auto detect the change of crumb setting and
  do proper exception handling. Credit: dougforpress
* Added a `User` class which will handle jenkins users related functions.
  Credit: dougforpres
* Added a method `Job#poll` which will poll for SCM changes programatically.
* Added a shortcut method `System#restart!` for force restart.

v0.13.0  [09-JUL-2013]
----------------------
* Jenkins XSS disable option is now supported. No inputs are required - the
  jenkins_api_client will automatically detech whether to use the crumbs or not
  when making the POST requests.
* Support for logging is added. Logs can be redirected to a log file and the
  log level can be customized. This implementation uses the `Logger` class so
  it follows the nice format in logging messages.
* The job `build` method will now optionally return the build number. This
  option should be used with care as the build method will wait till the
  jenkins job is placed on an executor from the build queue. By default the
  build number will NOT be returned. nil will be returned if the build number
  is not available. Also a Timeout error will be raised if the job waits in the
  queue for longer than the 'timeout' parameter. This timeout parameter can be
  set during the client initialization.
* Improved documentation
* Support for enabling/disabling jobs. Credit: [@dieterdemeyer][]
* Added functionality for copying jobs. Credit: [@dieterdemeyer][]
* Added functionality for wiping out the workspace of a job.
  Credit: [@dieterdemeyer][]
* Added functionality for listing jenkins users. Credit: [@dieterdemeyer][]
* Fixed a bug where the exceptions where not thrown when using the
  `get_console_output` method.
* Fixed a bug where the jenkins_path attribute was ignored when the server_url
  input argument is given. Credit: [@woodbusy][]
* support public/private key pair authentication for Jenkins CLI.
  Credit: [@missedone][]


v0.12.1  [25-JUN-2013]
----------------------
* Fixed a bug where the SSL support was not working properly with Ruby
  1.8.7/JRuby 1.6. (Pull [#85][]) Credit: [@brettporter][]

v0.12.0  [18-JUN-2013]
----------------------
* Authentication is now optional as not all Jenkins instances have
  authentication enabled by default. Credit: [@dougforpres][]
* Ability to retrieve build details so that more than just (`lamp color`) is
  available. Credit: [@dougforpres][]
* Ability to retrieve build test-results for those builds that have them.
  Credit: [@dougforpres][]
* Option to follow any 301/302 responses. This allows POST to build to follow
  the redirect and end up with a 200 response. Credit: [@dougforpres][]
* Minor change to the POST requests handling where jenkins instances with a
  proxy returns 411 if no form data is specified. Fixed by sending an empty
  hash. Credit: [@dougforpres][]
* As of Jenkins release 1.519, the job build returns a 201 code instead of 302.
  This was resulting in an exception and the exception handling is modified to
  handle this condition.
* The jobs that are not built yet have a new color (`notbuilt`) in the recent
  version of jenkins (> 1.517) which resulted in `invalid` status. This is fixed.

v0.11.0  [09-JUN-2013]
----------------------
* A new input argument `server_url` is supported which accepts the jenkins URL
  instead of IP address and Port. Credit: [@dieterdemeyer][]

* Various exception handling improvements. Credit: [@drnic][]
